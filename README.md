Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer for fMRI Classification

Author: Kazi Rakib Hasan

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. The analysis of 4D fMRI data, which comprises a 3D volume of the brain evolving over time, presents significant challenges due to its high dimensionality and complex spatio-temporal dynamics. The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying brain states from fMRI data, specifically distinguishing between cognitive tasks based on neural activity patterns. The dataset used for this task is a sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), focusing on an emotion-processing task where the objective is to classify whether the subject is viewing a face or a shape.
